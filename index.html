  <h1>My Local Guide to My Neighborhood</h1>


  <h2>Mattheus's Recs</h2>


  <h3>Chinatown Factory</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Chinatown Factory is a fairly popular ice cream spot in Chinatown.
  So be prepared for a decent line as a good amount of tourists come here.
  But the ice cream here is really good and I always get my ice cream in a 
  waffle cone. You honestly can't go wrong with any of the flavors so enjoy!</p>

  <h3>Broadway in Soho</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Broadway is where you can find most stores you can think of. Now personally
    me, I don't shop here too often because of the amount of tourists that crowd
    the area. But if you are in the area, window shopping is most people's plan.

  <h3>Fiat Cafe</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>If you're looking for a good brunch to get in between shopping, I would recommend this place. 
  Especially the panini sandwiches which are my favorite. And if the waiter likes you,
  they'll give you a small complimentary chocalate cake. This is a nice and cozy spot to visit.
